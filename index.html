        <h2>About StreetWise Planning</h2>
        <p>StreetWise Planning is a non-profit organization that gives civic leaders the evidence and insight they need to implement transportation solutions that work best for their community. Planners, public health professionals, elected officials, and community advocates struggle to find the data they need to prioritize and make decisions about transportation investments; the evidence is time-consuming to find, challenging to digest, and its credibility is difficult to evaluate. Civic leaders need to defend innovation in a risk-averse environment—we provide the data, case studies and lessons learned to help them make the case for transportation that works for their community. We deliver trusted, actionable evidence and insight that makes a real difference.</p>

Kelly has worked in city planning and landscape architecture for nearly 20 years, consulting on a variety of projects in transportation, stormwater management, community design and renewable energy. Kelly graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Urban and Regional Planning from Miami University, a Master in Landscape Architecture from the University of British Columbia and is soon-to-be a doctoral student in Urban Studies at Portland State University.

      <section id="what">
        <h2>What is StreetWise?</h2>
        <p>The relationship between certain transportation strategies, such as complete streets, and the outcomes we want to see in our communities, such as improved safety and health, have been described and documented in the research literature. However, this information isn’t readily accessible to those who need it: planners, elected officials, and the communities they serve. StreetWise is an online resource that illuminates these relationships in a visually rich and compelling way using the best evidence available. Additionally, StreetWise offers tips for framing conversations, anticipating challenges, and solving problems, which have been gleaned from extensive case study research.</p>

        <p>By collecting, synthesizing, and communicating this information clearly, StreetWise is a valuable resource for civic leaders who understand how important transportation is to community well being. StreetWise can be used to screen and prioritize projects by evaluating the kind of impacts similar projects have had in communities. StreetWise helps planners or advocates make the case for smarter investments by framing the issues and solutions in the context of their effects across multiple goals. Public health professionals can use StreetWise to better understand the connections between health and transportation. StreetWise changes the conversation about transportation—to broaden it beyond the idea of mobility and into the notion of access; to help people understand the consequences of their investments on community goals; and to offer greater transparency and accountability in the transportation decision-making process.</p>

      <section id="explore">
        <h2>Explore StreetWise</h2>
        <p>In February 2016, our lightweight StreetWise prototype was unveiled at the New Partners for Smart Growth Conference Tech Fair. We designed StreetWise to elicit feedback from conference attendees, who are among our core users, and received an overwhelmingly positive response. Thanks to all of you who provided input—it informed this iteration of the StreetWise prototype. Now everyone can make suggestions: the StreetWise prototype is publicly available <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>. Check it out and give us feedback. We need your insight.</p>

        <p><b>Got more feedback about the prototype?</b></p>
        <p><b>Have some case studies to share?</b></p>
        <p><b>Want to help index the evidence for use?</b></p>

        <p>We are always looking for academic and practitioner collaborators to build StreetWise. We are also building our advisory board and welcome subject matter experts. Contact Kelly at <a href="mailto:Kelly@thinkstreetwise.org">Kelly@thinkstreetwise.org</a> to get involved.</p>
