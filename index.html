        <h2>Why Streetsmart?</h2>
        <p>We get it. Civic leaders struggle to find the evidence they need to evaluate and prioritize transportation investments. The research is scattered, time-consuming to find, and difficult to digest. We do all the work of synthesizing the research and presenting it in an intuitive and easy-to-use format, without compromising quality or rigor.
        <p>Civic leaders need to make the case for solutions that work best for their community, which sometimes requires defending innovation. Streetsmart reduces risk by providing the evidence and examples of what works in other communities. We’ve got your back.</p>
        <p>Find success stories with key lessons learned in one easy-to-search place. Why re-invent the wheel? Streetsmart offers insight via case studies and guidebooks relevant to each topic area. Learn from others in the trenches, working on issues similar to yours. </p>

        <h2>About Streetsmart</h2>
        <p>Streetsmart, an incorporated nonprofit organization, gives you the evidence and insight you need to prioritize, defend, and decide what transportation solutions works best in your community. Our proof-of-concept prototype is ready for your feedback. We’re building partnerships and pursuing research projects to build the beta version of Streetsmart.
